# The website of the TCD SIGMEDIA group

This repository contains the source for the website of the TCD SIGMEDIA group.

## Overview

The SIGMEDIA website is hosted on GitHub and is based on Jekyll (with some additional tweaks which are not important here).
Because of this, it is important to understand the mechanisms of **git** and the workflow of **GitHub** before modifying the website.

In order to update the website, we have two possibilities:
doing it directly on GitHub or doing it offline and propagating the changes on Github.
This tutorial is structured in three phases:

-   Explaining the strategy briefly behind the edition of the website;
-   Preparing the environment to update the website offline;
-   Updating the website.

The second part should be informative for both online and offline modifications.


## Edition strategy

In order to simplify the management of the website, we distinguished two roles:

-   **administrators:** people who have the permissions to modify the repository of the SIGMEDIA website
-   **default users:** people who do not have these permissions

In order to modify the website, default users will have to fork the repository, do their modification and open a pull request.
Then, this pull request will be considered by an administrator.


## Preparing the environment

In this part, we will assume the following tokens:

-   **`<sigmedia_url>`:** the GitHub repository URL (either the main repository either your fork depending on your role and your workflow);
-   **`<rep_dir>`:** the local directory where the sigmedia repository is.


### Linux / MacOS (adapted from <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/>)

Here is the process to configure jekyll locally:

1.  Install the prerequisites (see <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/>)
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone <sigmedia_url> <rep_dir>`
3.  Position yourself in the directory: `cd <rep_dir>`
4.  Install jekyll and bundler: `gem install jekyll bundler`
5.  Install the bundles: `bundle install`
6.  Launch the server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
7.  Browse to <http://localhost:4000>

Steps 1 to 5 should only be done once.
You do not need to relaunch the server when after modifying the content.
Jekyll will generate the website at each (saved) modifications.


### Windows

Here is the process to configure jekyll locally:

1.  Install jekyll using the instructions from <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/>
2.  Clone `<sigmedia_url>` to `<rep_dir>` using your favorite git client
3.  Open a terminal and position yourself in `<rep_dir>`
4.  Install the bundles: `bundle install`
5.  Launch the server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6.  Browse to <http://localhost:4000>

Steps 1 to 4 should only be done once.
You do not need to relaunch the server when after modifying the content.
Jekyll will generate the website at each (saved) modifications.


## Adding a new information

### Adding a new member

To add a new member, you have to create a markdown file in the directory `_staff_members`.
This file should respect the following template:

    ---
    name: <name>
    position: <pos>
    email: <mail>
    [website: <url>]
    [github: <url>]
    profile_picture: <filename>
    join_date: <date>
    [graduation_date: <date>]
    [leave_date: <date>]
    ---

    <biography>

Here is the description of each items:

-   **name:** the name of the person
-   **position:** the position among the following values: academic, research\_fellows, phd\_students, research\_assistant, administrative
-   **email:** the email of the person with basic anti-robot transformations (@ -> `_at_`, . -> `_dot_`)
-   **website:** the address of the personal website of the person
-   **github:** the address of the personal github repository of the person
-   **profile\_picture:** the filepath to the profile picture of the person (it should be be stored in ./profile\_pictures)
-   **\_join\_date:** date in the format "YYYY/MM/DD" when the person joined the group
-   **\_graduation\_date:** date in the format "YYYY/MM/DD" when the phd student graduated
-   **\_leave\_date:** date in the format "YYYY/MM/DD" when the person left the group

Each item in the header between square brackets are optionals and the order doesn't matter.


### Adding a new job offer

Nothing yet here because I don't yet what is important for a job offer :D


### Adding a new reference

To add a new reference, you need to update the file `publis/<year>.bib` where `<year>` corresponds to year the of the publication to add.
If the file doesn't exist, you can create it.

#### Global formatting

In order to have the most homogeneous format, please use `bibtex-tidy`.
You have an online version for it at this address: <https://flamingtempura.github.io/bibtex-tidy/>

The configuration is based on the following command:

    bibtex-tidy \
        --curly --numeric --space=4 --align=13 \
        --duplicates=key,doi --no-escape \
        --sort-fields=title,shorttitle,author,year,month,day,journal,booktitle,location,on,publisher,address,series,volume,number,pages,doi,isbn,issn,url,urldate,copyright,category,note,metadata \
        --trailing-commas \
        --no-remove-dupe-fields \
        YOUR_FILE.bib

Finally, for an easier search, the bibtex file is sorted based on the keys of bibtex entries.

#### Key formatting

The format of the key associated with the bibtex entry is the following: `<first_author_last_name>_<year>_<counter>`.
The counter is incremented in order to avoid duplicate keys which are associated with the same (first) author.

## Updating/Removing information

To update or remove an information, simply update or delete the markdown file associated
