Sébastien Le Maguer is a postdoctoral research fellow based at Trinity College
Dublin and funded by the IRC-GOIPD scheme. His work focuses on Speech Synthesis
evaluation. Before joining ADAPT, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Saarland
University/DFKI (Germany) where he worked on the integration of information
density based features for speech synthesis; at INRIA/IRISA in Rennes (France)
where he worked on information retrieval with application on medical context. He
did his PhD on parametric speech synthesis evaluation at IRISA/Université de
Rennes 1. Aside these projects, he also has interest about speech pathology,
especially stutter-speech.
