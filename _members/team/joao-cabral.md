Joao Cabral was part of Sigmedia. He is currently  research fellow at Trinity  
College Dublin, in the School of Computer Science and Statistics, as part of the
ADAPT Centre and SIGMEDIA group. He was awarded a Ph.D. degree in Computer
Science and Informatics from the University of Edinburgh, U.K., in 2010, funded
by a European Commission Marie Curie Fellowship. His Ph.D. thesis contributed
with the novel integration of an acoustic glottal source model in HMM-based
speech synthesis, for improvement of speech quality and control over voice
characteristics. Before joining Trinity College Dublin in 2013, he also worked
as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University College Dublin, as part of
the CNGL research centre, from 2010. His main research is on improving
Text-To-Speech syntesis (TTS) methods based on statistical learning models. He
is also interested in evaluation methodologies of synthetic speech in the
context of multi-modal applications with virtual characters. His research
interests also include analysis of emotion and affect from speech and other
modalities (text, video, biosignals, etc.), voice transformation, prosody
modelling, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing
(NLP).
