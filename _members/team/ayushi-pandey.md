Ayushi Pandey is a PhD student based at Trinity College Dublin and is part of
the D-Real CRT Programme. Her work focuses on Speech Synthesis evaluation. She
has an M.A. in Cognitive Science from Johns Hopkins University and an M.Phil in
Computational Linguistics from International Institute of Information
Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H), India. For her PhD project, she is exploring features
in the acoustics of synthetic speech, that may contribute to the perception of
various attributes in the signal, particularly its naturalness. Her previous
work involves studying the perception of obstruents in non-native speakers of Hindi,
the development of bilingual corpora in Hindi-English, and analysing the errors of
forced alignment using code-mixed speech.
