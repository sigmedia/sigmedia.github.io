Conall received his MAI degree in Engineering from Trinity College Dublin in
2023 completing a project in the area of frame interpolation, which consisted of
building a Bullet-Time capture rig.

He is currently undertaking a PhD as part of the Sigmedia group under the
supervision of Prof. Anil Kokaram. His postgraduate research also focuses on the
same area as his MAI project with a view towards developing more computationally
efficient algorithms for frame interpolation.
