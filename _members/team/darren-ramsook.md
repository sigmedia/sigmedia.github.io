Darren received his BSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and MSc. in Data
Science from the University of the West Indies. His current research area is
perceptually motivated video restoration using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
which involves the use of non-traditional perceptual measures and approximations
as part of the loss function. His work shows that there are potential gains to
be made using these perceptual losses. These improvements are targeted towards
User-Generated Video Contents which is the common type of Videos found in
YouTube and Facebook.
